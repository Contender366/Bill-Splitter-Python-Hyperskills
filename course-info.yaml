summary: "<p>Eating out with friends is fun, but splitting the bill can be tricky.\
  \ This project helps you develop a Python-based tool to easily divide restaurant\
  \ bills equally. Input the number of friends and the total bill amount, and the\
  \ app calculates each person's share. No more awkward calculations or uneven splits!<br>\r\
  \nThe app handles cases where someone is feeling generous and wants to be the \"\
  lucky one\" and not contribute to the bill. This makes dining out more enjoyable\
  \ for everyone. Users can input friend's names, and the app displays a clear breakdown\
  \ of individual contributions. This project is designed to keep the focus on the\
  \ fun, not the finances.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/175?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
